## Proof $F_0=S_0e^{rT}$

Let's assume $F_0 < S_0 e^{rT}$. Now we can show there exists risk-free profit by doing the following:
1. Short stock for $S_0$
2. Invest $S_0$ at risk-free rate
3. Agree to a long future contract $F_0$
4. ...
5. Buy stock for $F_0$
6. Return stock to pay back the loan

Now your profit is $S_0e^{rT}-F_0>0$.

Next let's assume $F_0 > S_0 e^{rT}$. By doing the follwing:
1. Loan $S_0$ with interest rate $r$
2. Buy stock for $S_0$
3. Agree to a short future contract $F_0$
4. ...
5. Sell stock for $F_0$
6. Pay back the loan for $S_0e^{rT}$

We achieve a risk-free profit of $F_0-S_0 e^{rT}>0$.

Thus it follows that $F_0=S_0e^{rT}$.
